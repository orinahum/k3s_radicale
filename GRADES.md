# Grades

# Commentary

Great work on the project structure, organization and setup. It needs somewhat polishing but the direction is good and approach to details seems to be in correct manner.
The grades are temporary, due to question in [suggestions file](https://github.com/zero-pytagoras/k3s_radicale_ori_avishay/blob/main/SUGGESTIONS.md), I'll update the grade after the answer
### Grades:

- Avishay  : 90
- Ori      : 90
